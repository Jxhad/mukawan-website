### Understanding the File Structure

Your Mukawan website consists of the following key files and folders:

```
mukawan-website/
├── dist/                          # Production build files
│   ├── index.html                 # Main HTML file
│   ├── assets/                    # CSS, JS, and image files
│   │   ├── index-[hash].css      # Compiled CSS
│   │   ├── index-[hash].js       # Compiled JavaScript
│   │   └── mukawan-logo-[hash].png # Your logo
│   └── favicon.ico               # Website icon
└── src/                          # Source files (for reference)
    ├── App.jsx                   # Main React component
    ├── App.css                   # Styles
    └── assets/                   # Original assets
```

### Files You Need to Upload

For deployment, you only need the contents of the `dist/` folder:
- `index.html` - The main webpage
- `assets/` folder - Contains all stylesheets, JavaScript, and images
- Any additional files like `favicon.ico`

## Part 3: Uploading Your Website to IONOS

### Method 1: Using IONOS File Manager (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Access File Manager**
   - In your IONOS control panel, find "File Manager" or "Website Builder"

2. **Navigate to Your Domain Folder**
   - Look for a folder named after your domain (e.g., `mukawan.com`)
   - Open the folder and look for `public_html` or `htdocs` folder
   - This is where your website files should be placed

3. **Upload Your Files**
   - Delete any existing files in the public folder (like default index.html)
   - Upload all contents from your `dist/` folder
   - Make sure `index.html` is in the root of the public folder
   - Upload the entire `assets/` folder with all its contents

4. **Set Permissions**
   - Ensure files have proper permissions (usually 644 for files, 755 for folders)
   - The file manager typically handles this automatically

### Method 2: Using FTP/SFTP (Recommended for Advanced Users)

1. **Get Your FTP Credentials**
   - In IONOS control panel, look for "FTP Access" or "SSH/FTP"
   - Note down:
